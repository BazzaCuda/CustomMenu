# CustomMenu

NOW AVAILABLE FOR DOWNLOAD!

Build your own customized Windows desktop menu.  Unlimited submenus with unlimited menu items.

All your favorite applications, folders, Windows settings and Windows applets at your fingertips and easily accessible just by right-clicking on your desktop.

A great alternative to the nightmarish clutter of your Windows Start Menu or even your current desktop context menu.

Many, many exciting features. And it's all free. (see the Wiki for a quick preview).

Once CustomMenu contains all the functionality that it's likely to have (based on user feedback), the source code will be released. 

See the Wiki overview (and screenshots) at https://github.com/BazzaCuda/CustomMenu/wiki/Overview

Follow and stay tuned for updates.
