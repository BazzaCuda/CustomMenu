# CustomMenu

**Windows 11 users** - if right-click doesn't activate **CustomMenu**, please let me know in Discussions (https://github.com/BazzaCuda/CustomMenu/discussions)

**Tip of the Day**: the easiest way to get started with CustomMenu is to select all the shortcuts on your desktop and simply drag and drop them onto your empty menu tree (left panel) in the config window. CustomMenu will create a menu item for each shortcut complete with the correct icon, starting directory and any parameters. That gets your custom menu up and running instantly with minimal effort. At a later date, if you wish, you can take your time re-arranging them and putting them into suitable submenus.
